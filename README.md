# Refactoring with the Stock Analysis VBA code

## Overview of Project: 

For this challenge, we are looking to imporve upon the original file that was provided to Steve. To do this we refactored the code used in Module 2 solution code. This was done by looping through all the data one time, using code efficiently and making it easier to compherend while collecting the same information. Following the refactor the run times where analyzed to determine on whether the refactor was successful in making the VBA script faster.

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

##Summary:
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
